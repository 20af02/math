The emphasis is on the informed use of mathematical software; in particular, the presentation helps readers learn enough about the mathematical functions in {MATLAB} to use them correctly, appreciate their limitations, and modify them appropriately. The book makes extensive use of computer graphics, including interactive graphical expositions of numerical algorithms. It provides more than 70 M-files, which can be downloaded from the text Web site www.mathworks.com/moler. Many of the more than 200 exercises involve modifying and extending these programs. The topics covered include an introduction to {MATLAB}; linear equations; interpolation; zeros and roots; least squares; quadrature; ordinary differential equations; Fourier analysis; random numbers; eigenvalues and singular values; and partial differential equations. Motivating applications include modern problems from cryptography, touch-tone dialing, Google page-ranking, atmospheric science, and image processing, as well as classical problems from physics and engineering.},
